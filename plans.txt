Future projects that I want to include on my website, and in what form:


2. Terrain
- Perhaps several photos, as access to the game itself through the website could prove to be problematic
- Compare development to 2D
- Mentions of those that you can't tell just by looking at the photos
    - Like the boat that is moving around in the lake
    - The game idea itself, collecting items as fast as possible

3. Alt Zone (Art)
- All the art I make for the game
- Starting from my Alt Zone specific looking
- Some sort of cute one shot scene that contains as many furniture items as possible
- Other pieces can be shown "at the side", if they do not fit the scene

4. Roso Games (Other projects)
- Both the og Roso Games project, but also the Spring 2026 Game Jam project
- Screenshots of what it was about, and then text explaining what my role was in the game

5. 3D - made for school
- School projects need a folder for these
- Maybe not the most basic pieces, but the more complex pieces that have taken time and effort to make

6. Advanced Game development
- 

7. Web game platforms
- 

8. Photography
- Show 3 photos in the gallery, but upon clicking any of them, it opens the pop up gallery with as many photos as I wanna put there

9.



ALREADY AT THE WEBSITE BUT NEED CHANGES:
- Old school projects (from year 1) can be put in one folder, as they are just... well... filling the page
- Instead of school projects, maybe rename it to something that I can use after graduation? Or add some text that makes clear what school I did all this for
